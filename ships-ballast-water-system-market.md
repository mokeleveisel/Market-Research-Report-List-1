<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ships Ballast Water System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Method</li><li>Physical Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ships ballast water treatment market is categorized into two main types: chemical and physical methods. Chemical methods involve using biocides or disinfectants to kill harmful organisms in ballast water before discharge. In contrast, physical methods utilize techniques such as filtration, UV radiation, or thermal treatment to achieve similar results without chemicals. Both approaches aim to prevent the spread of invasive species and protect marine ecosystems, complying with international regulations for ballast water management.</p></p>
