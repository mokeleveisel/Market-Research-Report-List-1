<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biventricular Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temporary Pacemakers</li><li>Permanent Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biventricular pacemaker market is primarily categorized into temporary and permanent pacemakers. Temporary pacemakers are used short-term, often in hospital settings to manage acute heart conditions, providing immediate support until the underlying issue is resolved. In contrast, permanent pacemakers are designed for long-term implantation, addressing chronic heart rhythm disorders by delivering continuous electrical stimulation to the heart. This distinction reflects patient needs, underlying conditions, and the duration of therapy required for optimal cardiac function.</p></p>
